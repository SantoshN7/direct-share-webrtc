  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>This WebRTC-based application is a personal hobby project built to explore real-time peer-to-peer communication technology. It is intended for experimentation, learning, and casual testing.</p>

  <h2>Why This Project Exists</h2>
  <p>I created this project to learn more about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>WebRTC APIs (audio, video, data channels)</li>
    <li>Peer-to-peer networking concepts</li>
    <li>STUN/TURN signaling and real-time communication</li>
    <li>Frontend development workflows</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Important Notes</h2>
  <p>This is not a commercial product. It is not designed for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sensitive conversations</li>
    <li>Business communication</li>
    <li>Professional use</li>
    <li>Emergency or safety-critical communication</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The app is provided "as is" with no guarantees of uptime, privacy, performance, or security beyond standard WebRTC browser encryption. Use it at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app does not store personal data or media. Peer connections are handled directly between browsers whenever possible. Temporary signaling data may pass through servers to establish connections but is not saved.</p>
